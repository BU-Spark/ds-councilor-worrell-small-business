## Topic
Our topic is focusing on analyzing the foot traffic, spending rate, and other predictors to determine what Boston's District 4 can do to improve on attracting small businesses and compared this idea to other districts.

## Organization
We've organized each assignment --- `Deliverable 0`, `Deliverable 1`, `Deliverable 2`, `Deliverable 3`, `Deliverale 4`, `Deliverable 5`, `Final Report` --- into folders for legibility. We've also organized all of our datasets into the `datasets` folder.
